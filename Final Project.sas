Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): The mean sleep duration is 7 hours ùúá=7
Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): The mean sleep duration is not 7 hours ùúá‚â†7.*/

/* It is Two tailed Test */
/* Interpretation of One-Sample t-Test Output
The one-sample t-test examines whether the mean sleep duration is equal to the hypothesized value of 7 hours:

Test Results: The mean sleep duration is 7.1321 hours, with a standard deviation of 0.7957.
t-Statistic and p-Value: The t-statistic is 3.21, and the p-value is 0.0014, which is less than the typical significance level of 0.05.
Conclusion: Since the p-value is below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the average sleep duration significantly differs from 7 hours.
Confidence Interval: The 95% confidence interval for the mean sleep duration is (7.05, 7.21), which does not include the hypothesized value (7 hours), further supporting the conclusion.
This indicates that the average sleep duration in the sample is statistically significantly higher than the hypothesized value of 7 hours. */

/* The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that if you take a large number of independent
and identically distributed random variables, their sample mean will follow a normal
distribution (approximately) regardless of the original distribution of the variables,
provided the sample size is sufficiently large. This is true even if the underlying
distribution is not normal.
The distribution of Sam‚Äôs average payoff after 520 spins will be approximately normal.
The mean of this distribution will be close to the expected value, which is $0.91.
The spread (standard deviation) of the distribution of the average payoff will be $0.5513.
Therefore, while individual payoffs may vary significantly, the average payoff after 520
spins will cluster around the expected value of $0.91, with most average payoffs lying
within about $0.55 of this value.
