Project Overview

This project examines the relationship between sleep health, lifestyle choices, and cardiovascular health. Using statistical analysis and data visualization, we identify key factors that influence sleep quality and duration.
Dataset

Observations: 400
Variables: 13 (including lifestyle factors, sleep metrics, cardiovascular health, and sleep disorders)
Categorized Blood Pressure Levels: Normal, Elevated, Hypertension Stage 1, Stage 2, and Crisis
Objectives

Identify key factors affecting sleep health.
Provide insights into lifestyle improvements.
Highlight actionable recommendations for healthier habits.
Statistical Methods

Univariate Analysis: Examines demographic, lifestyle, and sleep-related variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Identifies relationships between variables such as:
Stress level and sleep duration (strong negative correlation).
Resting heart rate and sleep duration (moderate correlation).
Gender, occupation, and sleep quality/duration.
Physical activity level and daily steps (strong correlation).

Key Findings:

Occupation significantly impacts both sleep and physical activity.
Stress levels negatively affect sleep duration and quality.
Higher physical activity levels are linked to better sleep quality.
No strong correlation between sleep duration and physical activity.
Majority of individuals in the dataset have Hypertension Stage 1.

Next Steps:

Investigate potential causes behind identified correlations.
Explore urban vs. rural lifestyle impacts on sleep.
Determine the most effective habits for improving sleep quality.

Tools & Technologies:

Statistical Software: SAS
Data Analysis Techniques: Correlation analysis, t-tests, regression models, data visualization.
